## EXPERIENCE

**Gas Turbine Engineering Intern**  
*EthosEnergy, Turin, Italy — Summer 2025*  
- EthosEnergy is a global provider of rotating equipment services, with the Turin shop specializing in heavy industrial gas turbine manufacturing, upgrades, and repairs. Over the course of the internship, delivered validated blade designs and workflow improvements that supported the Turin team’s engineering work.  
- Led a design study evaluating the impact of inlet and outlet metal angles on blade efficiency by comparing automated and manual profiling in AxSlice; used Excel and simulation results to quantify a 2.36% performance error from real data, demonstrating high accuracy and informing workflow improvements.  
- Proposed innovative methods to accelerate turbine design workflows, including surrogate modeling with machine learning to speed up AxSTREAM iterations and plans to automate ANSYS post-processing for thermal-structural simulations, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

**Senior Design Capstone**  
*Geometric Modeling of Flagella in Single-Cell Organisms — August 2024 – May 2025*
- Geometric modeling is the study of methods and algorithms for the mathematical description of shapes. Over the course of the project, integrated theoretical and applied mathematical frameworks to advance existing models of flagellar dynamics, using creative problem-solving to identify novel, application-driven improvements.  
- Developed novel mathematical equations for force, torque, and power output for flagella interacting with the fluid, deriving equations of motion directly from geometric parameters such as curvature and torsion.  
- Designed an innovative extension to the Immersed Boundary Method to add dimensionality to flagellar shapes, enabling further analysis of perturbation and dynamics in fluid-interacting models for helical geometries.
